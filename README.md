# üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Workflow Engine API

This project lets you define **custom workflows** (like state machines), start new instances of them, and transition between states based on actions.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to get you started:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the API

* Run the project using Visual Studio, `dotnet run`, or from your IDE.
* Once it‚Äôs running, you‚Äôll see something like:

  ```
  Now listening on: http://localhost:5068
  ```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Workflow Definition

This is where you define your workflow ‚Äî all the **states** it can be in, and the **actions** that move it from one state to another.

In Postman (or any REST client):

* **Method:** `POST`
* **URL:** `http://localhost:5068/workflow-definitions`
* **Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "id": "my-workflow",
  "name": "Sample Workflow",
  "states": [
    { "id": "start", "name": "Start", "isInitial": true, "isFinal": false },
    { "id": "middle", "name": "Middle", "isInitial": false, "isFinal": false },
    { "id": "end", "name": "End", "isInitial": false, "isFinal": true }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "id": "begin", "name": "Begin", "fromStates": ["start"], "toState": "middle" },
    { "id": "finish", "name": "Finish", "fromStates": ["middle"], "toState": "end" }
  ]
}
```

* You should get a `200 OK` if it works.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start a New Workflow Instance

Now that your workflow is defined, you can start a new instance of it.

* **Method:** `POST`
* **URL:** `http://localhost:5068/workflow-definitions/my-workflow/start`

You‚Äôll get a response like:

```json
{
  "id": "99eba76a-c1df-4299-9664-e71bdda51799",
  "definitionId": "my-workflow",
  "currentState": "start",
  "history": []
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Copy the `id` from the response. That‚Äôs your `instanceId`.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute an Action (Transition to the Next State)

You can now move this instance from one state to the next using an action.

* To move from **start** to **middle**:

  * **Method:** `POST`
  * **URL:**

    ```
    http://localhost:5068/instances/{instanceId}/actions/begin
    ```

* Then to move from **middle** to **end**:

  * **POST**
  * **URL:**

    ```
    http://localhost:5068/instances/{instanceId}/actions/finish
    ```

Just replace `{instanceId}` with the ID you copied earlier.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ View the Current State and History

Want to see what state your instance is in?

* **Method:** `GET`
* **URL:**

  ```
  http://localhost:5068/instances/{instanceId}
  ```

You‚Äôll get something like:

```json
{
  "id": "99eba76a-c1df-4299-9664-e71bdda51799",
  "definitionId": "my-workflow",
  "currentState": "end",
  "history": [
    { "actionId": "begin", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "actionId": "finish", "timestamp": "..." }
  ]
}
```

---

## üéâ Done!

That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve:

1. Created a workflow definition.
2. Started a workflow instance.
3. Moved it through defined states using actions.
4. Viewed the current state and history.

Happy experimenting!
